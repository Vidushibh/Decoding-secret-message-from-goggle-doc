Decoding the Secret message

The objective is to write a function that takes in the URL for a Google Doc as an argument, 
retrieves and parses the data in the document, and prints the grid of characters. 

When printed in a fixed-width font, the characters in the grid will form a graphic showing a sequence of uppercase letters, which is the secret message.
